                                    <p>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve embraced every project and challenge as a stepping stone toward personal and professional growth. While I am still building expertise in my domain, I can already feel a growing passion for development. I’ve been working with multiple programming languages, each offering new insights and perspectives. So far, I’ve explored <b>Python</b>, which has become my go-to language for automation and backend tasks, and <b>JavaScript</b>, which I’m learning to enhance my understanding of web development.<br> Working with <b>Flutter</b> for mobile apps has also introduced me to Dart, while <b>Arduino programming</b> has given me hands-on experience with hardware integration.<br><br>

                                        Each project, from geolocation-based attendance systems to color-sensing robotic arms, has pushed me closer to mastering the logic and creativity needed to solve real-world problems. I aim to expand my expertise further by exploring other technologies and frameworks as I progress. The coming years will be an exciting phase of discovery, where I hope to transform my curiosity into practical skills and my dedication into meaningful experiences. By the end of these four years, I see myself becoming a passionate and competent developer, prepared to leave a positive impact in the tech world.
